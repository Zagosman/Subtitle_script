# Subtitle_script ver. 1.0
 This is a script that creates subtitle layers for Adobe AE form a text file 

This version is very basic. It was created as a proof of concept and it will be improved later. Also it is a nice way for me to learn Github

Algorythm is as follows:
1) Copy your text to a source.txt file and delete unnecessary data if needed
2) Run FromTxtToArray.py
3) Go to export.txt and copy exported array to a Subtitle_script_version1.0.jsx
4) You should assign this array to a variable called var txtArray
5) Open Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit, then open your After Effects project file and select a composition that you want subtitles to be inserted to
6) Run the Subtitle_script_version1.0.jsx
